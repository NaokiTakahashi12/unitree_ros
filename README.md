# Introduction

This package is intended to be the ros2 version of [unitree_ros](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_ros).

I do not plan to support all Unitree robots, only Unitree Go1.

Some attention will be paid to compatibility, but full compatibility is not guaranteed as it is subject to the [REP](https://ros.org/reps/rep-0000.html).
